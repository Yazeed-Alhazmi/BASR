<h1>BASR: Broad Assistance Search and Rescue</h1>

This project implements a drone-based AI system to assist in search and rescue (SAR) missions, specifically focused on locating lost individuals in desert environments.

By combining a drone equipped with a high-resolution camera and an object detection model (YOLOv11m), BASR enhances traditional rescue missions with real-time detection

<h2>System Overview</h2>
- **Drone Unit: A drone captures live aerial footage using a 1080p+ camera and transmits it via RTMP stream.
- *Detection* Model: A YOLOv8n model runs on the ground station to detect lost individuals in real time.
